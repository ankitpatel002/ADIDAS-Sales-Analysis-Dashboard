# ADIDAS-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

I created an ADIDAS Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to offer a comprehensive view of the brand's sales performance across different dimensions. The dashboard includes several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Total Sales: A sum of all sales across different categories.
Total Profit: Profit generated from the sales.
Product Category: A breakdown of sales by product type.
Profit Margin: The percentage of profit from sales.
Max Profit: The highest profit achieved by any category.
Units Sold: The total number of units sold.
Price per Unit: The average price per unit sold.
To enhance the interactivity, the dashboard provides slicers that allow users to filter data by:

Product: Filter by different product categories.
Retailer: View sales by specific retailers.
Region and City: Analyze geographical performance.
Invoice Date: Filter by specific sales periods.
The dashboard contains the following visualizations:

Stacked Bar Charts:
Total Sales by Product Overview.
Total Sales by Region.
Total Sales by Retailer.
Quarterly Operating Profit Overview.
Stacked Column Chart: Displays total monthly sales.
Pie Chart: Shows sales breakdown by method (e.g., online, in-store).
Map Visualization: A geographical view of total sales by city.
These insights provide an in-depth analysis of sales performance, helping stakeholders track key metrics and identify trends across different regions, products, and retailers.
